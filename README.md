Comprehensive Briefing: Generative AI, LLMs, and Advanced AI Agent Development
1. Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence capable of creating new data based on training samples. This can include images, text, audio, and video. While applications like ChatGPT and Google Bard are prominent examples, generative AI has deeper roots in various neural network architectures.
1.1 Core Concepts of Generative AI:
• Generative AI's Definition: Generative AI "generate new data based on a training sample." It is self-explanatory, as the name suggests the AI generates something new.
• Types of Data Generated: Generative AI can produce "images, ... text, ... audios, ... videos." These are forms of unstructured data.
• Two Main Segments: Generative AI is broadly divided into "generative image model" and "generative language model," with LLMs falling into the latter.
1.2 Evolution of LLMs:
LLMs have evolved from foundational neural network architectures:
• Neural Network Types: Deep learning encompasses three primary neural network types: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
    ◦ ANNs: Used for structured data with numerical or categorical columns, typically for classification or regression.
    ◦ CNNs: Primarily used for image processing, involving convolution, pooling, and flattening layers.
    ◦ RNNs: Designed for "sequence related data," featuring a "feedback loop" where the output of a hidden layer is fed back as input until the entire sequence is processed.
• Advanced RNN Architectures: The limitations of basic RNNs led to more advanced architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which are "going to process a sequence data."
• Sequence-to-Sequence Mapping: These architectures enabled various mapping techniques, including one-to-one, one-to-many (e.g., image captioning), many-to-one (e.g., sentiment analysis), and many-to-many (e.g., language translation).
• Encoder-Decoder Models: These models addressed the "fixed length input and output" problem of earlier many-to-many models by using an encoder to process the input sequence into a "context vector" and a decoder to generate the output sequence.
• Attention Mechanism: Introduced to overcome the limitations of encoder-decoder models in handling long sequences by allowing the model to "focus on specific parts of the input sequence" while generating the output. The paper "Attention Is All You Need" (2018) marked a "breakthrough in the NLP history."
• Transformer Architecture: This architecture, based entirely on attention mechanisms (specifically self-attention), became the "base architecture behind this LLM." All modern LLMs, including GPT models, use Transformer as their foundation.
1.3 Discriminative vs. Generative Models:
• Discriminative Models: Focus on classifying or predicting outcomes based on input data. They "perform a supervised learning" by training on specific input-output pairs. Examples include classical machine learning models and deep learning models for classification.
• Generative Models: Aim to "generate new data based on a training sample." They typically involve "unsupervised learning" for grouping and then "supervised finetuning" for specific tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an example where a "generator" creates synthetic data and a "discriminator" differentiates it from real data.
1.4 LLM Characteristics and Capabilities:
• Definition: An LLM is a "large language model which has been trained on a huge amount of data and it is behaving like it is generating something."
• Power of LLMs: A single LLM can perform various tasks like "text generation, chatboard, ... summarization, translation, code Generation."
• Milestones in LLMs: Key models that advanced LLM capabilities include BERT, GPT (with variants GPT-1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4), XLM, T5, and Megatron. These models primarily use Transformer architecture, categorized by those using "encoder only," "decoder only," or "both encoder and decoder."
    ◦ Encoder-based: BERT, Roberta, XLM, Albert, Electra, DTA.
    ◦ Decoder-based: GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4 (and the entire GPT family).
    ◦ Encoder-Decoder based: T5, Bart, M2M, BigBird.
2. Practical Application and Frameworks
2.1 OpenAI Ecosystem:
OpenAI's models are central to many generative AI applications:
• Accessing OpenAI Models: OpenAI provides various models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, DALL-E, Whisper, Embedding, and Moderation. Access typically requires an "OpenAI API key" and payment "regarding the tokens."
• Open-source Alternatives: While OpenAI offers powerful proprietary models, open-source alternatives like BLOOM, Llama 2, Palm (Google), Falcon, and Claude are available and can be used "without any charges."
• OpenAI Playground: Provides an interface to experiment with different models, roles (system, user, assistant), and parameters like "temperature" (for creativity) and "maximum length" (for token limits).
• Function Calling: A key feature that allows LLMs to "connect large language model to the external tool." This enables the LLM to understand when to invoke a custom function or interact with a third-party API based on the user's prompt, extracting necessary arguments (e.g., flight origin and destination).
2.2 LangChain Framework:
LangChain is a powerful open-source framework for building LLM-powered applications:
• Purpose: LangChain acts as a "wrapper on top of this open AI API" and other APIs, enabling the creation of "complex AI Agents."
• Advantages over direct API calls:
    ◦ Data Integration: LLMs are trained on public data (e.g., GPT models till September 2021). LangChain allows integration of "private data resources" and "third party API" for real-time information (e.g., current World Cup winner).
    ◦ Complex Workflows: Facilitates building complex AI agents and "managing complex dialogue systems using a graph-based approach."
    ◦ Modularity: Allows connecting multiple LLM calls and components ("chains") to create more sophisticated applications.
• Key Components:
    ◦ Prompt Templating: Enables constructing prompts dynamically based on "input variable." This is crucial for building flexible applications where prompts can be generated from user input.
    ◦ Chains: Connect "multiple component" (e.g., LLM and prompt template) to create a sequence of operations. * LLMChain: A basic chain connecting an LLM and a prompt template. * Simple Sequential Chain: Connects multiple chains sequentially, where the output of one chain becomes the input for the next. * Sequential Chain: Similar to Simple Sequential Chain but allows for more complex input/output key mapping between chains.
    ◦ Agents: Use "for calling any third party tool." They leverage LLMs to decide which tool to use and in what sequence, providing dynamic problem-solving capabilities (e.g., using Google Search API for real-time data).
    ◦ Memory: Crucial for conversational AI, allowing the LLM to "sustain the memory" of previous interactions, similar to ChatGPT. "Conversation Buffer Memory" and "Conversation Buffer Window Memory" are examples, with k parameter controlling the number of previous conversations remembered.
    ◦ Document Loaders: Used to "load any sort of a document," including PDF, Excel, CSV, or HTML files, to integrate custom data into LLM applications.
    ◦ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique to combine LLMs with external data sources for more accurate and up-to-date responses. It involves "indexing of external data," "embedding" documents into vector representations, and then "retrieving" relevant information based on user queries to augment the LLM's generation.
2.3 LangGraph Framework:
LangGraph is a Python library for building advanced conversational AI workflows:
• Graph-based Approach: LangGraph "design, implement and manage complex dialogue systems using a graph-based approach." It's built on top of LangChain.
• Core Elements:
    ◦ State: A "shared data structure that holds the current information or context of the entire application," acting as the application's memory.
    ◦ Nodes: Components that "perform a specific operation or action." They can access and modify the state.
    ◦ Edges: Connections between nodes, defining the flow of the workflow. * Directed Edges: Simple connections where the workflow moves from one node to the next. * Conditional Edges: "Specialized connections that decide the next node to be executed based on the specific condition or logic applied to the current state" (e.g., if-else statements).
    ◦ Start/End Points: Mark the beginning and conclusion of the workflow.
    ◦ Tools: "Specialized functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks."
    ◦ Tool Node: A "special kind of a node whose main job is to run a tool," connecting tool output back into the state.
    ◦ StateGraph: The main element for "build and compile the graph structure," managing nodes, edges, and the overall state.
    ◦ Runnable: A "standardized executable component that performs a specific task within an AI workflow," acting as a fundamental building block.
3. Advanced Concepts in Generative AI
3.1 Vector Databases and Embeddings:
• Embeddings: Numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture their semantic meaning. Text is converted into "a set of numbers" or "vector" to be processed by LLMs.
    ◦ Traditional Encoding (without DL): Methods like Document Matrix (Bag of Words), TF-IDF, N-grams, One-Hot Encoding, and Integer Encoding. These often result in "sparse matrix" and are "contextless" (meaningless).
    ◦ Deep Learning-based Embeddings (with DL): Techniques like Word2Vec and other neural network-based methods generate "dense vector" that "is having more meaning" and capture contextual relationships.
• Vector Databases: Specialized databases designed to store and manage these high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling "similarity search operation."
    ◦ Why Vector Databases?: Traditional relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases are inefficient for storing and querying vectors based on similarity. Vector databases are optimized for "fast retrieval" of similar vectors.
    ◦ Examples: Pinecone and ChromaDB are widely used vector databases. * Pinecone: A "fully managed" cloud-based vector database (AWS, Google, Azure) "designed to hander realtime search and similarity matching at scale." It's powerful but "cost is a like major disadvantage" and has "limited query functionality." * ChromaDB: An "open source database" similar to Pinecone, designed for "Vector storage and retable," and can be run locally (on CPU), offering a cost-effective alternative.
3.2 LLM Training and Fine-tuning:
LLMs undergo a multi-stage training process:
• Pre-training: LLMs are initially "trained on two trillion tokens of data" from publicly available sources using "standard Transformer architecture." This stage focuses on learning broad language patterns and knowledge.
• Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT): The pre-trained model is "fine tuned with custom data" using "supervised learning." This involves creating a labeled dataset of "request and response" pairs, often generated by "real human being human agents" to refine the model's behavior for specific tasks and reduce "hallucination."
• Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF): This crucial stage further refines the model and reduces "hallucination."
    1. Response Generation: The SFT-trained model generates multiple responses to a given prompt.
    2. Human Ranking: Human annotators "assign a rank" to these responses based on quality, relevance, and helpfulness.
    3. Reward Model Training: A "fully connected neural network" (the reward model) is trained on this ranked data, learning to predict human preferences.
    4. Policy Optimization: Algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) use the reward model to assign "rewards" to the LLM's generated responses, guiding the model to produce higher-quality outputs that align with human preferences. This process iteratively updates the LLM's weights.
4. Developing LLM-Powered Applications
4.1 Development Workflow:
A typical LLM application development involves several steps:
• Project Setup: Creating a project directory, setting up a virtual environment (e.g., using Conda), and installing necessary libraries (requirements.txt).
• Environment Variables: Securely managing API keys and other sensitive information using .env files and python-dotenv.
• Modular Coding: Organizing code into logical modules (e.g., src folder with __init__.py files to treat folders as Python packages).
• Experimentation: Initial development and testing of LLM interactions in Jupyter Notebooks or similar interactive environments.
• Web Application Development: Building a user interface using frameworks like Streamlit or Flask for interaction.
• Deployment: Deploying the application to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS EC2) using tools like Docker for containerization.
4.2 Practical Examples:
• MCQ Generator: An application that generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from a given text.
    ◦ It involves designing a prompt to instruct the LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo) to act as an "expert McQ maker" and generate questions based on provided text, number of questions, subject, tone, and desired JSON response format.
    ◦ Utilizes LangChain's PromptTemplate and LLMChain to construct and execute the quiz generation, and SequentialChain to add a "review chain" for evaluating the generated MCQs.
    ◦ Data is read from text or PDF files, processed, and then fed to the LLM.
• Medical Chatbot: A chatbot that answers questions based on a custom medical PDF.
    ◦ Data Integration: Downloads a medical PDF and extracts its content.
    ◦ Text Splitting: Divides the extracted text into "chunks" with "overlap" to handle LLM context window limitations and maintain context across chunks.
    ◦ Embedding Generation: Converts text chunks into "vector embedding" using OpenAI's embedding models.
    ◦ Knowledge Base: Stores these embeddings in a "Vector DB" (e.g., Pinecone or ChromaDB) to create a "semantic index."
    ◦ Query Embedding: Converts user questions into vector embeddings.
    ◦ Similarity Search: Retrieves "rank result" (top similar chunks) from the knowledge base based on the query embedding.
    ◦ LLM Refinement: Sends the ranked results and the user's question to the LLM (e.g., Llama 2 or GPT-3.5 Turbo) to "filter out my exact answer" and "give the correct answer." This is a prime example of RAG.
• Invoice Extractor (Google Gemini Pro): An application that extracts information from images of invoices.
    ◦ Utilizes Google's Gemini Pro model, which supports "multimodality" (reasoning across text, images, video, audio, and code).
    ◦ Takes an image input, converts it into bytes, and sends it along with a text prompt to the Gemini Pro model.
    ◦ The prompt instructs the model to behave as an "invoice extractor" and retrieve specific information (e.g., deposit requested, invoice recipient).
• Text-to-SQL Converter (Google Gemini Pro): Converts natural language questions into SQL queries for a given database.
    ◦ Connects to an SQLite database (e.g., student.db) with predefined tables and columns.
    ◦ Uses a "prompt" that instructs Gemini Pro to act as an "expert in converting English question to SQL code" and provides examples of English questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
    ◦ The Streamlit interface takes English questions as input, which are then passed to Gemini Pro to generate SQL queries.
    ◦ The generated SQL query is executed against the SQLite database, and the results are displayed to the user.
4.3 Open-Source LLMs and Tools:
• Motivation: To avoid "cost" of proprietary APIs and for "research purpose as well as the commercial purpose," open-source LLMs are gaining traction.
• Llama 2: A family of LLMs developed by Meta (Facebook), available in various parameter sizes (e.g., 7B, 13B, 70B). Llama 2 models have shown competitive "accuracy score" compared to models like GPT-3.5 Turbo.
    ◦ Quantization: Crucial for running large models on less powerful hardware (CPU) by converting "floating number to integer number," significantly reducing "memory size." This is facilitated by libraries like llama-cpp-python and cTransformers.
• Hugging Face Hub: A central repository for "open source" LLMs, datasets, and tools. It allows users to "download all the required Library" and models for various tasks (e.g., text-to-text generation) and use them locally.
• Google Colab / Neural Lab: Cloud-based platforms that provide GPU access for running computationally intensive LLM tasks and experiments, circumventing local hardware limitations.
